# Usage

To use AI Files, copy the `.aifiles` and `.aifiles.json` files to your home directory.

```
mkdir git
cd ~/git
git clone https://github.com/jjuliano/aifiles.git
cp aifiles/.aifiles.sample ~/.aifiles
cp aifiles/.aifiles.json ~/.aifiles.json

```

where filename is the name of the file you want to process.
